    Frame(data=None, track=False)
    
        A zmq message Frame class for non-copy send/recvs.
    
        This class is only needed if you want to do non-copying send and recvs.
        When you pass a string to this class, like ``Frame(s)``, the 
        ref-count of `s` is increased by two: once because the Frame saves `s` as 
        an instance attribute and another because a ZMQ message is created that
        points to the buffer of `s`. This second ref-count increase makes sure
        that `s` lives until all messages that use it have been sent. Once 0MQ
        sends all the messages and it doesn't need the buffer of s, 0MQ will call
        ``Py_DECREF(s)``.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
    
        data : object, optional
            any object that provides the buffer interface will be used to
            construct the 0MQ message data.
        track : bool [default: False]
            whether a MessageTracker_ should be created to track this object.
            Tracking a message has a cost at creation, because it creates a threadsafe
            Event object.
